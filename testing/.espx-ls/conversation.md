To accept command line arguments in your Rust program, you can use the `std::env::args` function, wh
ich returns an iterator of the command line arguments. Here's how you can modify your `main.rs` to a
ccept and print out the command line arguments:

```rust
use std::env;
use std::fs;

fn main() {
   
 let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    println!("{:?}", args);
}
```

This code collec
ts the command line arguments into a vector of strings and then prints them. The first argument (`ar
gs[0]`) is always the path to the program itself, and any additional arguments will follow in the ve
ctor. If you want to work with the arguments (beyond just printing them), you can iterate over `args
` or access them by index as needed, keeping in mind to handle cases where the expected arguments mi
ght not be provided.
