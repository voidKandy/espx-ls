Given the document path, it appears you are working with Rust. To write a function in Rust that adds two integers, you can do it as follows:

```rust
fn add_two_integers(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    let result = add_two_integers(5, 3);
    println!("The sum is: {}", result);
}
```

In this example, `add_two_integers` is a function that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of type `i32` (32-bit integers), and returns their sum, also as an `i32`. The `main` function then calls `add_two_integers` with 5 and 3 as arguments, stores the result in `result`, and prints it to the console.
